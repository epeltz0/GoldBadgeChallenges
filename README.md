# GoldBadgeChallenges

Gold Badge Challenges are a collection of repository console applications that help users store information.

These applications work by running the console application and taking in user input and storing it into one of three collections. 
The user can add any amount of information without limit. The application makes the stored information available to view, update, or delete. 

These three applications were made more for business. The badge application would work well for security, menu would be good for a food service industry, and the claims would
be useful for an insurance company.

These applications are made up of a console application, a class library and a unit test. The console application runs the whole application; it contains the program and program UI files.
The class library holds both the created object the user will use in the application as well as the properties of each object and the the class repository which holds CRUD methods
(create, read, update, delete). The unit test is used to test the methods within the class repository to ensure that the application is running smoothly.

This project is currently functioning but is still being updated to ensure the most smooth operation possible.
